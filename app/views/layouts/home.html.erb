            <p>Street Child is a UK education and child welfare organisation that has worked with over 30,000 street children in Sierra Leone, Liberia and Nepal since 2008. Street Child empowers children by providing education opportunities and income-generating initiatives to enable families to build a sustainable future. Furthermore, they have been at the forefront of the ebola crisis: providing care for over 13,000 children orphaned by the virus by resettling them within a safe and secure family home and enrolling them in school. We have a strong relationship with Street Child and have been lucky enough to see the amazing work they do on the ground in Sierra Leone first hand. Every trip booked with us will directly support their work.</p>
